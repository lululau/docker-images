This script have some abbreviations to use in insert mode while writing Ruby code. The goal is to speed up (more!) code writing.
There are "triggers" when typing def, for, begin, inject, class, module, collect, detect, each, find, find_all, map, reject, select, attr_reader, attr_writer, attr_accessor. For example, when typing "class" you get

class ClassName
end

and the cursor is positioned on "ClassName", where you can use cw to replace it to the name you want on the class.

There's a little video on http://eustaquiorangel.com/blog/show/438 about the script. Non-portuguese readers, please just click on play.
