Vim can support complex window layouts, but they can put users off because
they reduce the size of the main editing window.  ToggleMaximize addresses
this issue, by allowing the user to switch between a large editor window,
and his own complex window layout.

Press Ctrl-F or Ctrl-\ to maximize the size of the current window, press
again to restore the original window layout.

Ctrl-V and Ctrl-H toggle maximize in vertical/horizontal direction only.

Maximization is forced to respect winminwidth and winminheight, so if you
have these set, other windows will not fully shrink to the edges.

If the user changes the size of any windows after maximizing, the script
still thinks the toggle is ON, so next time it is used it will restore your
old layout, rather than re-maximize (unlike some window managers).
